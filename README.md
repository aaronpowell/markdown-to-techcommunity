This is a tool that will convert a markdown file to the HTML that is needed for posts on https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/. Mostly it's just used to generate the right syntax for code blocks.

It won't strip front matter or anything like that, so clean the HTML as needed.

## Usage

```bash
npm install
npm start <path-to-markdown>
```
